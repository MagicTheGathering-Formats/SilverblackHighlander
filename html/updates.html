    <h2>Initial List, 01.03.2023</h2>
        <p>
            The purpose of the points list is to create a balanced meta where various archetypes such as Aggro (Burn, etc.), Midrange, Control, and Combo (Storm, Reanimator, etc.) are viable. 
            An nother one is, that Decks can Not Just Play all the powerfull cards. For example Strip Mine and Sol Ring would be in every deck
            <br><br>
            The First Version of the list uses cards from other banlists. From there we try to reduce the number with the next updates on the list.
            <br><br>
            Aggro ... Mono colored Aggro decks could be to fast, because the format has mostly tapped dual Lands. 
            This could hinder the possibility of 2+ colored decks. 
            Aggro should be slowed down a little because of the Singleton nature of the format. 
            Although Combo Decks, Like reanimoter could be even too fast for Aggro to comped. 
            If mono colored Aggro Decks become to strong it could be a possibility to go up to a startinglife of 25.
            <br><br>
            Control ... has Access to some of the most efficent removal spells in the Game
            <br><br>
            Combo ... has several very good Options. Strom and iniative are taxed with much points from the start. Enablers Like DARK Ritual vs. Playoffs Like empty the warrents. We decided to Tax the Playoffs. We want Strom to be a viable Archetype and will tune the Points list until IT IS. Initiative in the other Side gets the soft ban for now.
            <br><br>
            Midrange ... Not cleare If Midrange Decks fit in the format. Let us know, when you did find a way to make it work ;) 
            <br><br>
